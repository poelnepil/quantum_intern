# Regression on the tabular data

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**You have a dataset (internship_train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target column. Your task is to build model that predicts a target based on the proposed features. Please provide predictions for internship_hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE.** 

- The train dataset contains 53 anonymized features and a target column.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- The Regression on the tabular data.ipynb, file contains the analysis of the dataset and building model that predicts a target,
 target metric was RMSE (*best score - 0.0016033823281488468, based on Random Forest Regressor*). The analysis was followed by regression using two methods: Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
- The Regression on the tabular data.py, file contains code for the analisys process and building the model.
- The model predictions.csv file contains predicted target values based on the internship_hidden_test.csv.
- The requirements.txt file contains all used libraries.
