# Soil erosion detection

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Here is one of the open problems in Quantum. Soil erosion is a really unwanted process that spoils huge areas of fertile land. Your task is to train model for erosion detection.**

 - Sentinel2 tile (T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2).
 - Masks with soil erosion for this tile (masks directory).

- The Soil erosion detection.ipynb, file contains aerial imagery analysis and a neural network training model (UNet) for detecting erosion in soil.
- The Soil erosion detection.py, file contains code for the analisys process and building the model.
- The solution report.txt, file contains my proposals about soil erosion detection problem.
- The requirements.txt, file contains all used libraries.
