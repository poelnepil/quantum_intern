Soil erosion is closely related to factors such as forest cover, soil health, intensity of impact on the soil and slope, and can be reflected in them.
The lower accuracy of models based on multiplication is explained by the assumption of an equal independent relationship between factors and soil erosion.
The suitability of a model depends on a number of factors, including data requirements and ease of use.
Lack of data is usually the main drawback of model application.
The method proposed in this study is based entirely on remote sensing methods and is relatively
remote sensing methods and is relatively easy to use.
The necessary data on each factor for the model can be obtained directly from remote sensing images.
This advantage makes the model more applicable.
It is intended to be used as a spatially explicit tool for identifying areas with potential soil erosion.
Information on the identification of areas that are susceptible to soil erosion will be useful for geoanalytics, farming, and construction.
